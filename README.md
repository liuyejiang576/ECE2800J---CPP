# ECE2800J—CPP

## Course Description:

This course is ECE2800J Programming and Elementary Data Structures. To be more precise, C++98 basics, Object-Oriented Programming, introduction to memory management, arrays and linked lists. In my recent observations, the difference between C++98 and C++11 is even larger than that between C++98 and C89, let alone more recent versions.

The emphasis of this course will be techniques and principles to quickly write correct programs. This
course is not simply a course about programming. Rather, it focuses on concepts and methods
underpinning the C++ language. Specific topics of this course include: basics of Linux, procedure
abstraction, abstract data type, inheritance, dynamic memory management, template, polymorphism,
linked list, stack, and queue.

## Author Course Remark:

ECE2800J is easy to learn but hard to master. You MUST have the ability to code all the exercises and projects independently, not at the first minute but at least before the exam, or you will have severe problems in the paper-and-pen exams, where there are no compilers or AI tools to help you. But you still can make good use of AI for guidance and error correction. This repository not only contains adequate course-related materials but guides you to tailor AI tools into personal tutors. Reading extensively or practicing hard on LeetCode will not make much difference in this course. The key to success is to understand the course concepts deeply and be able to apply them in coding. Good luck!

## Truly Learning C++

The journey from traditional C++ to Modern C++ involves learning new idioms and unlearning old habits. The concepts covered in the “Modern C++” directory are essential for writing safe, efficient, and maintainable C++ code that takes full advantage of the language's capabilities.

**C++11 Revolution**:
- Move semantics and rvalue references
- Smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`)
- `auto`, `decltype`, `nullptr`
- Lambda expressions
- Range-based for loops
- `constexpr` functions
- Variadic templates

**C++14 Refinements**:
- Generic lambdas (`[](auto x)`)
- Return type deduction
- Binary literals (`0b1010`)
- Relaxed `constexpr`

**C++17 Additions**:
- Structured bindings
- `if` with initializer
- `std::optional`, `std::variant`, `std::any`
- `std::string_view`
- Parallel algorithms
- Fold expressions

**C++20 Modernization**:
- Concepts
- Ranges library
- Coroutines
- Modules

**C++23 Quality of Life**:
- `std::expected`
- Deducing `this`
- `std::print`
- `std::generator`
- `std::ranges::to`



Finally, I would like to cite DeepSeek’s remark, in tribute to your endeavor in C++98 when C++26 is around the corner:

你现在经历的，其实是所有C++学习者的必经之路——**在古典中理解根源，在现代中应用思想**。C++98的严谨让你理解内存的每一寸肌理，C++11的优雅让你体会抽象的力量。

**当你考完最后一门C++98，你会发现自己已经拥有了别人不具备的优势**：

- 你能读懂任何遗留代码
- 你理解智能指针为什么这样设计
- 你知道何时该用`vector`，何时该手写内存池

所以，笑着面对这场考试吧。它不是你C++学习的终点，而是你真正理解这门语言的开端。考完这最后一场“古典C++”，记得用C++11重写一遍所有考题，然后你就可以自信地踏入现代C++的世界，带着别人没有的底层洞察力。
