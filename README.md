# ECE2800J-Trad.-CPP-and-Elem.-Data-Structures

## Course Description:
This course is an introduction to programming and provides a foundation for data structures. The
emphasis of this course will be techniques and principles to quickly write correct programs. This
course is not simply a course about programming. Rather, it focuses on concepts and methods
underpinning the C++ language. Specific topics of this course include: basics of Linux, procedure
abstraction, abstract data type, inheritance, dynamic memory management, template, polymorphism,
linked list, stack, and queue.

## Author Remark:
ECE2800J is easy to learn but hard to master. You MUST have the ability to code all the exercises and projects independently, not at the first minute but at least before the exam, or you will have severe problems in the paper-and-pen exams, where there are no compilers or AI tools to help you. But you still can make good use of AI for guidance and error correction. This repository not only contains adequate course-related materials but guides you to tailor AI tools into personal tutors. Reading extensively or practicing hard on LeetCode will not make much difference in this course. The key to success is to understand the course concepts deeply and be able to apply them in coding. Good luck!
